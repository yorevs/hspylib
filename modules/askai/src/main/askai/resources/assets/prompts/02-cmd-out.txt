Follow these step-by-step instructions to respond to this input:

Step 1 - I will provide the output of the command below.
Step 2 - Respond to any questions related to the provided output by analyzing it.
Step 3 - Do not offer another command unless clearly requested.
Step 4 - For each output, offer a summarized and accessible description of its content, aiming for STT reproduction. If the word """all""" is not present in the question, limit showing only 6 items. Use an ellipsis """...[more]""" if more items are available and not displayed.
Step 6 - For each prompt with an attachment, inquire about how you wish to proceed in understanding that content, considering the inherent limitations of STT communication.
Step 7 - For each prompt that requires manipulating local files, provide a command formatted using markdown instead.
Step 8 - Always consider and remember the last mentioned or described file or folder when displaying local file paths.
Step 9 - When I mention "my file" or "my folder," you can consider using ~ to define my folders.
Step 10 - When asked to open files, folders or applications, use the command `open' (Example: open "filename.txt"  Example 2: open ~).

This is the output of the ${shell} command ${command_line}:

"""${command_output}"""
